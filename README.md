# chat_bot

A project to help you build your own language model (LM) — especially using WhatsApp data (or your own custom data) — with minimal hassle.  
This repository provides tools, scripts, and guidance to train, fine-tune, and deploy a conversational AI.  

GitHub: https://github.com/lord230/chat_bot.git

##  Features

- Preprocessing pipeline for chat / conversational data  
- Training scripts to fine-tune a causal LM on your own dataset  
- Support for using WhatsApp chats or arbitrary text conversation logs  
- Example configurations / templates you can adapt  
- Simple inference / chat loop for testing the chatbot

##  Repository Structure

Here’s a rough outline of the files and folders:

chat_bot/
├── data_aug/ # Data augmentation scripts or utilities
├── bot # Core chatbot / training / inference code
├── req.txt # Required dependencies
└── README.md # This file



- `data_aug/` — scripts to clean, augment, or transform chat logs  
- `bot/` — main model training, fine-tuning, and chat/run code  
- `req.txt` — Python package dependencies

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lord230/chat_bot.git
   cd chat_bot

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
   
3.Install dependencies:
   ``` pip install -r req.txt ```
   
4. Prepare your data:

Put your chat logs or conversation data in a designated folder (e.g. data/)

Clean / format them as needed (see data_aug/ for help)

## Training / Fine-Tuning

Use the scripts in the bot/ directory to train or fine-tune the model. Example steps:

1. Preprocess your dataset (tokenization, splitting, formatting)

2. Configure training parameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)

3. Run the training script

4. Keep checkpoints and evaluate periodically

You may want to refer to the bot/ code to see arguments and default settings.


## Inference / Chat

Once you have a trained model checkpoint:

1. Load the tokenizer and model (in bot/)

2. Use the chat loop (or script) to send user input and receive responses

3. Optionally integrate into a front end (e.g. WhatsApp integration, web UI, etc.)

You can adapt the sample chat loop you posted (in your earlier message) into this repo.



## Notes & Caveats

Training a language model can be resource-intensive (GPU, VRAM)

Be careful about overfitting to small datasets

Always validate your model’s outputs to avoid unsafe / biased generation
